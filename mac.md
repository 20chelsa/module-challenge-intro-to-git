# Setting Up Your Computer

Welcome to day 1 at BloomTech, today we are going to spend time setting up your computer and learning the tools that you will be using to complete this program. Just like day 1 at a job, you will need to get your environment set up to build and run your code. Complete the set up tasks below and then get started on the research questions. Once you have finished check out the submission instructions in the `README.md` file to turn in your assignment for the day. 

## Set Up Tasks 
1. [ ] Download x code - these are your developer tools for mac 
2. [ ] sign up for a GitHub account - please use a professional username. We recommending using your `firstname` `lastname`
3. [ ] Set up your SSH key - GitHub uses SSH to keep their files secure. You will need to set up one SSH key for every computer that you want to access your GitHub account on. 
4. [ ] Download Zoom - make sure your zoom display name is your `first name` `last name`
5. [ ] Download Slack - make sure your slack display name is your `first name` `last name` 
6. [ ] Download VS code - this will be the tool you use to write all of your code. We recommend installing the following extensions: 
- [ES Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- Spell Checker
- Live Server
7. [] Download Node.JS - we will be using Node.JS to run the tests in all of our javaScript assignments. Test driven development is a common practice in the world of web dev. You can read more about it here:
